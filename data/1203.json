He gives order to strengthen the city walls and the fortifications.[1]",
    "May – June – The Crusader fleet rounds Greece and stops at Negroponte (modern-day Halkis), where the local authorities submit to Alexios Angelos.

    "July 2 – Crusader leaders sail close to the city's walls in order to display the young Alexios Angelos, where they call upon the Byzantines to rise up in his favour.

The Venetians set fire to the buildings inside the Golden Horn walls, and then abandon the occupied fortifications.[7]\nJuly 17–18 – Alexios III tries to counterattack from the Gate of St. Romanus but retreats without a fight.
